Research encompasses several overlapping areas:
1. Peculiarities regarding use of critic loss functions, tail exponents, and shadow means,
2. Multi-step returns and replay buffer coupling in continuous action spaces,
3. Learning in multiplicative (non-ergodic) domains, maximising the time-average growth rate,
4. Applications to strongly non-Markovian financial gambles using historical prices, and
5. Designing fully autonomous self-learning guidance systems for real-time target acquisition.

Implementation using [Python](https://www.python.org) 3.10 and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) 1.11 with environments interfaced through [Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/) 0.23.

## Key Findings
### Additive Experiments
* Critic loss evaluation using MSE is an acceptable starting point, but use of HUB, MAE, and HSC should be considered as there exists serious potential for ‘free’ performance gains depending on environment.
* Critic loss mini-batches appear to exhibit extreme kurtosis (fat tails) and so aggregation using 'empirical' arithmetic means (Monte-Carlo approach) severely underestimates the true population mean.
* Multi-step returns for continuous action spaces using TD3 and SAC is not advised due to lack of global policy maximisation across the infinite action space unlike the finite discrete case.

### Multiplicative Experiments
* The maximisation of probability-based expectations methodology universally prescribed by contemporary decision theory is inappropriate for multiplicative processes due to conflation of probabilities with payoffs.
*  State-of-the-art model-free off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms that are designed to maximise expected additive rewards are modified to operate in any conceivable multiplicative environment.
* The model-free agent now fully autonomously, self-learns the actions required to maximise value through the avoidance of steep losses, represented by raising the time-average growth rate.
* Direct applications encompass any situation where percentage changes (as opposed to numerical changes) in underlying values are reported, such as financial trading, economic modelling, and guidance systems.
* The theory is experimentally validated by converging to known optimal growth-maximising actions (leverages) for gambles involving coin flips, die rolls, and geometric Brownian motion.
* Cost-effective risk mitigation using extremely convex insurance safe havens is investigated where the model-free agent develops a strategy that indisputably increases value by reducing the amount of risk taken.

### Market Experiments
* Trained agents capable of operating in extremely non-Markovian financial markets using only consecutive past returns as inputs for highly liquid USD-denominated securities modelled as zero margin CFDs.
* Historical time series simulation is entirely non-parametrically performed using shuffled holdout out-of-sample forecasting with there existing significant long-term positive correlation across each simulation.
* Performance across a myriad of complex environments is found to exhibit substantial positive skew in wealth growth, however, is highly dependent on both the historical time-period and the financial assets included.

### Guidance Experiments
* Created fully automated guidance systems that control the trajectory of point projectiles to targets in unbounded 3D space while under the effects of slowly varying vector fields such as wind.
* Presented novel energy efficient multi-stage actors for operation in extremely remote environments and designed countermeasure systems for intercepting projectiles.
* Experimental results are currently both pending completion and further fine tuning.

## Data Analysis
Comprehensive discussion and implications of all results are described in `Grewal-RLMD.pdf`.

The data regarding optimal leverage experiments (NumPy arrays), agent training performance (NumPy arrays), and the learned models (PyTorch parameters) have a total combined size of 4.8 GB.

The breakdown for optimal leverage experiments, additive agents, multiplicative agents, and market agents are 0.4 GB, 2.7 GB, 0.9 GB, and 0.9 GB respectively. All data is available upon request.

## Usage
Using the latest [release](https://github.com/temp-rgrewal/rlmd/releases) is recommended where we adhere to [semantic](https://semver.org/) versioning.

Binary coin flip, trinary die roll, and geometric Brownian motion (GBM) experiments pertaining to empirical optimal leverages are contained in the `lev/` directory with instructions provided inside each of the files.

Training on financial market environments requires the generation of historical data sourced from [Stooq](https://stooq.com/) using `scripts/gen_market_data.py` with customisation options regarding asset selection and dates available within the file.

All reinforcement learning agent training is executed using `main.py` with instructions provided within the file. Upon the completion of each experiment, relevant directories within `results/` titled by the reward dynamic (additive or multiplicative or market) will be created. Inside each will exist directories for data and models with subdirectories titled by the environment name.

Final aggregated figures for all agent experiments that share common training parameters are generated using `scripts/gen_figures.py`. The specific aggregation details must be input in the file.

Comprehensive tests during compilation have been written for all user inputs. The script will also terminate if critic network backpropagation fails mainly due to the use of strong outlier-supressing critic loss functions and or divergence in particular environment state components. Furthermore, an explicit test run for initial stability of agent training can be conducted using `tests/agent_tests.py` for a variety of scenarios. Similarly, one can use `tests/lev_tests.py` to conduct tests on a reduced-scale of all optimal leverage experiments.

Accessing the code involves the following commands:
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/temp-rgrewal/rlmd.git

cd rlmd
```
Install all required packages (ideally in a virtual environment) with or without dependencies using:
```commandline
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

pip3 install -r requirements--no-deps.txt
```
Optimal leverage roll experiments for a particular "gamble" are conducted with:
```commandline
python lev/gamble.py
```
Historical financial market data is sourced and aggregated using:
```commandline
python scripts/gen_market_data.py
```
Reinforcement learning agent training and evaluation is executed with:
```commandline
python main.py
```
Summary figures for agent performance are generated using:
```commandline
python scripts/gen_figures.py
```
There are also additional prerequisites for installing certain packages (without mentioning dependencies):
* `box2d-py` and `pygame`: Required only for training on [Box2D]( https://gym.openai.com/envs/#box2d) continuous control tasks.
* `box2d-py` and `pybullet`: A C++ compiler such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) is necessary. On Windows, install Visual Studio Community and in the installer select the “Desktop development with C++” workload with both optional features “MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools” and the “Windows 10 SDK”.
* `gym`: The interface compiler [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) must be [installed](http://www.swig.org/Doc4.0/SWIGDocumentation.pdf) to connect C/C++ programs with scripting languages. For Linux either build from the distributed tarball or directly fetch the package from a repository. On Windows, extract the swigwin zip file and add its directory to the system PATH environment variable.
* `mpi4py`: A Message Passing Interface (MPI) library for Linux or [Microsoft MPI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=57467) is only required for training on [DeepMimic](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02717.pdf) environments ported to [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org)
* `pandas-datareader`: Required only when updating existing or creating new market environments by directly obtaining historical financial market data (prices and volumes).
* `torch`: Only the exact version should be installed with compatible compute platforms following the official [instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Different versions can significantly reduce speed and lead to broken function/method calls.
