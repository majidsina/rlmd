            likely due to several reasons either individual or combined.

            For additive environments, mini-batch losses might be excessively supressed
            by highly smoothing loss functions.

            For multiplicative/market environments it may be due to several reasons
            such as the previous cause, state components diverge due to the possibility
            of unbounded environments, and/or other mysterious events.
